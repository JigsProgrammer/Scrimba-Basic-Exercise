# Scrimba Apple-Oranges Storage Exercise

This exercise was an interesting one. I had quite a hard time solving this without searching it up and consulting ChatGPT. I had the right mindset though: That, I need the if-elseif conditionals inside the for loops, but it was after searching it up that I realized that the for loop goes through all the indices and then the conditionals help in finding which are indices are apples and which are oranges.

All in all, this was a good experience, and it helped me know one way how to use all function, for loop, if-elseif statements, and the += operator of the .textContent method.
